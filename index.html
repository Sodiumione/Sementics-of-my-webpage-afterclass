              <i><bold>QURAN</bold></i>
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Quran, the foundational text of Islam, is revered by Muslims
              as the direct and unaltered word of God, revealed to the Prophet
              Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of approximately
              23 years. This divine revelation is captured in classical Arabic
              and is composed of 114 surahs (chapters) that vary greatly in
              length, each containing numerous verses (ayahs) that address a
              broad spectrum of topics including theology, morality, law, and
              guidance for personal and communal conduct. The Quran is not only
              a spiritual guide but also a comprehensive framework for living a
              righteous life, encompassing aspects of faith, worship, ethics,
              and social justice. It provides detailed instructions on how to
              interact with others, handle various life situations, and maintain
              justice and compassion in society. For Muslims, the Quran is
              recited and memorized during daily prayers and throughout life,
              serving as a constant source of inspiration and reflection. Its
              profound impact extends beyond religious practice, influencing
              Islamic art, literature, and legal systems, and shaping cultural
              and social norms across diverse Muslim societies. The Quran’s
              teachings continue to resonate with millions, offering timeless
              wisdom and guidance that shape the spiritual and moral dimensions
              of their lives.

              <h2>
                <bold><i>TAWRAT</i></bold>
              </h2>
              <p>
                In Islam, the Tawrat is regarded as one of the major divine
                revelations, given by God to the Prophet Moses (Musa) as a
                guiding scripture for the Israelites. This sacred text, which
                comprises the first five books of the Hebrew Bible—Genesis,
                Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy—contains
                comprehensive laws, commandments, and ethical teachings intended
                to direct the moral and social conduct of its followers. Muslims
                acknowledge the Tawrat as a significant part of the continuum of
                divine guidance, respecting its role in shaping the religious
                and cultural identity of the Jewish people. However, Islamic
                tradition also holds that while the Tawrat was originally a true
                and uncorrupted revelation, it has undergone changes and
                distortions over time. This belief is based on the Islamic view
                that previous scriptures, including the Tawrat, were altered or
                misinterpreted before the final revelation, the Quran, was sent
                to Prophet Muhammad. The Quran, which Muslims believe to be the
                ultimate and unaltered word of God, is seen as both confirming
                the truth of earlier scriptures and providing necessary
                corrections to any deviations that may have occurred. In this
                way, the Tawrat is honored as part of a broader divine message,
                while the Quran is viewed as the final and complete guidance for
                humanity.

              <h2>
                <bold><i>ZABUR</i></bold>
              </h2>
              <p>
                In Islam, the Zabur is regarded as one of the sacred scriptures
                revealed by Allah to Prophet Dawood (David). The Quran
                acknowledges the Zabur in several verses, affirming its divine
                origin and significance. While the exact contents of the Zabur
                are not detailed in the Quran, it is understood to consist of
                poetic hymns and psalms that emphasize themes of divine worship,
                morality, and righteousness. The Quranic references highlight
                the Zabur's role in the broader context of divine revelation,
                which includes the Torah (Tawrat) given to Prophet Musa (Moses)
                and the Injil (Gospel) given to Prophet Isa (Jesus). These
                scriptures, including the Zabur, are seen as part of a continuum
                of guidance provided by Allah to humanity through various
                prophets. Although the Zabur itself is not extensively detailed
                in Islamic texts beyond these references, it is respected for
                its contribution to the prophetic tradition and its role in
                reinforcing the core message of monotheism and ethical conduct
                shared across the Abrahamic faiths. Thus, the Zabur occupies an
                important place in Islamic spirituality and theology, reflecting
                the continuity and consistency of divine guidance through
                history.

              <h2>
                <bold><i>INJIL</i></bold>
              </h2>
              <p>
                In Islam, the Injil is recognized as a sacred scripture revealed
                by Allah to Prophet Isa (Jesus), and it is considered an
                integral part of the divine message sent to humanity. The Injil,
                often equated with the Gospel in Christian tradition, is
                believed to have contained guidance, teachings, and moral
                principles intended for Jesus’ followers, promoting
                righteousness and ethical conduct. The Quran acknowledges the
                Injil in various verses, such as in Surah Al-Imran (3:3-4),
                which states that Allah sent down the Torah, the Injil, and the
                Criterion (Quran) as guidance for people. Despite its revered
                status, Islam holds that the Injil, like previous scriptures,
                has undergone alterations and misinterpretations over time. As a
                result, while the Injil is respected as part of the prophetic
                tradition, the Quran is regarded as the final and complete
                revelation, offering the ultimate and unaltered guidance from
                Allah. This view underscores the Quran's role in confirming and
                clarifying the messages of earlier scriptures, including the
                Injil, and highlights the continuity and consistency of divine
                guidance throughout history.
